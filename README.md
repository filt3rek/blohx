## Rules

You can click a brick on the screen and drag the mouse to make a selection.

When the bricks on the corners of the selection are of the same color, the selection is valid, the selected blocks are turned and their color changed.

If a brick is turned for the first time, it gives a point.

Points are multiplied by the speed of the action.

The goal is to turn all the bricks on the screen.

## Building from sources

The game builds on Flash and all other openFL targets : Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android and HTML5.
